# Sparks_Bank(Basic Banking System)
This is the first task in the Web Development Domain intern at GRIP. The website has been hosted at XAMPP and the dummy data of 14 customers has taken. The tech stack used is HTML5, CSS,JavaScript, MySQL and php. This website allows us to view all the entries of the customers, tranfer money among them and also view the complete list of transactions. If an amount more than that of the legible amount is entered then a warning will be shown as well.
